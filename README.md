# analog-clock
This is a simple JavaScript & CSS analog clock.

## Install
You can install the project dependencies using the following command.

```
npm install
```

## Command Line Interface
There are a couple of commands available for generating the CSS and minifying the JS.

```
npm run clock:build
```
Generates the needed files and copies them to the right location. This is useful if you just want to see the final outcome.

```
npm run clock:watch
```
Watches for each js & scss file change and regenerates the files. Very useful if you want to play around with the code and adjust it to your needs.
